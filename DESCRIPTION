Description: This package deals with presence-absence data representing the temporal evolution of
    an ecological community. A single data frame can be then subdivided into different groups according
    to one of the factors in the data frame. The package uses a upgma-based clustering
    method to classify the groups according to their colonization-extinction affinity. Then, it
    calculates the best partition for the set of groups according to Akaike Information Criteria.
